# Dimensionality Reduction of the "Predict Student Dropout and Academic Success" Dataset

This project explores various dimensionality reduction techniques on the "Predict Student Dropout and Academic Success" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), T-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), Isomap, and Factor Analysis are applied to uncover underlying patterns and insights within the data.

## Tools and Libraries
- Programming Language: Python
- Key Libraries: sklearn, pandas

## Dataset Overview
The dataset was collected from a higher education institution and includes information about students' academic performance, demographics, and socio-economic factors. Each row represents a student, while the columns cover a variety of feature types:

- Total Rows: 4,427 students
- Total Columns: 37 features
1 Ordinal feature
18 Numerical features
18 Categorical features (8 of them Binary)
This project aims to analyze and reduce the dataset's dimensionality while preserving the most important information for predicting student dropout and academic success.
